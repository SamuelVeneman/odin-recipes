    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            8 egg yolks
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup granulated sugar, divided
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup heavy cream
        </li>
        <li>
            3 cups half-and-half
        </li>
        <li>
            Pinch salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li> 
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and half of the sugar. Set aside. 
        </li>    
        <li>
            n a medium saucepan, stir together the cream, half-and-half, salt, and remaining sugar. Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring often, until it comes to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to the egg mixture while whisking constantly (this helps prevent the eggs from cooking). Repeat with another 1/2 cup of the cream mixture.
